Things to put in options:
    - turn "highlight possible captures" on and office

-during "must flip", needs some kind of "cannot play piece here" alert

-in "capturePossbile" : need to fix the point where alert fires off
    > tiny delay, like 1 millisecond, will be enough to make sure the alert appears
       AFTER the previous turn's move appears on the gameboard

- insert the if statements for 'classic' and 'gameOn' booleans
