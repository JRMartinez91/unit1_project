Things to put in options:
    - turn "highlight possible captures" on and off
    RESOLVED
    
-during "must flip", needs some kind of "cannot play piece here" alert
RESOLVED.

-in "capturePossbile" : need to fix the point where alert fires off
    > tiny delay, like 1 millisecond, will be enough to make sure the alert appears
       AFTER the previous turn's move appears on the gameboard  
RESOLVED.

- insert the if statements for 'classic' and 'gameOn' booleansc
RESOLVED;

{
- something the "show possible captures" button does is interfering
    with the ability to start a new game in Classic mode. but it only happens sometimes.
    the error seems to be that capturePossbile is sending out pings
    that assume white tiles are enemies, despite it being White's turn
    turn switch is forced to true when a new classic game starts,
    so is it even possible that turnswitch is the problem?

    inversePing uses turn switch to determine which tiles are friends or enemies.
    is this the source of the error?
}
RESOLVED: it was a typo in the resetBoard() function-- 'turnswitch' was misspelled,
and thus never actually reset. Haaaaa.
